        <h3>2D Platformer</h3>
        <p>SWAP is a 2D platformer I worked on with a small team of developers. The premise of the game is that the player's limbs are interchangeable with various tools, and must navigate different levels using these tools to your advantage. I contributed to the writing, the programming and the scoring of this game, but my primary contribution was involved in creating all the visual assets and the sound effects. The first 20 seconds of the demonstration video displays the menu theme I wrote for the game using a range of virtual instruments. The grand and epic energy of the song creates a tension that encourages the player to start the game. This demonstration shows the second version of the game, whereas the first version used royalty free sound effects which were less immersive and consistent. One example of this is the sounds of the enemies' weapons. Originally their guns would make the same sound as the player's, but now they emmit a different pitch and consist of different layers. Where the lasers and guns were mostly synthesized using programs such as Vital and Falcon, elements like the grappling hook were created using recorded sounds. The grappling hook sound is made primarily of a knife scraping across a cheese grater, layered upon a dumbell moving across a wooden counter. At 3:33 I briefly demonstrate how I synthesized the siren that the boss emmits before raining down bombs from the sky.</p>

        <h3>April Sound Design Challenge</h3>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KjVYRADQjM?si=NAfPudk8Tolt0n3l" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This video demonstrates some of my favourite games to work on during Airwiggle's April Audio Challenge. The clips come from mostly unfinished games by smaller studios and developers. The diversity of clips supplied pushed me to expand my techniques and use sound design in ways I hadn't experienced before. I learned a lot from this, from how atmos can be much more important in some settings than others, and the importance of UI sounds still feeling thematic. Though most of the sounds in this were recorded at my desk, many of it still went through heavy processing and layering. For example, the sparks at 1:10 were created by sticking cardboard into a fan, and using pitch, EQ, and distortion to achieve the desired sound. Similarly, I was tasked to complete the first clip with just a small sound library. Thus, I sampled the rustling of the insulation of a vacuum cleaner to create the footsteps, and processed the sound of a burp to create the monstrous growl. </p>

        <h3>Animation Re-Foley</h3>
        <p>This is an example of stripping the foley from an existing film scene and re-recording foley using innovative techniques. This was an exercise I undertook in order to strengthen my skills in recorded sound design. Much of the recordings were taken around different locations to force myself to be creaative with location recording. Some of the sounds were created by doing what is shown on screen, such as walking on particular textures and the rustling of clothes. Other sounds required more creativity in it's sound design, such as scraping a hot water bottle across a wooden surface and layering it to achieve different motions of tyres scraping off the road.</p>

        <h3>Scoring, Mixing and Writing</h3>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HFe0wrTXBpM?si=Rmml2ams0D2Gg-51" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="textR">In this advertisement for Smarter Travels, I pitched the idea to advertise the Leapcard using a 1940s aesthetic to make it stand out. My original script was refined by film students and I worked closely on the project in pre-production and post-production. I studied ragtime songs, a style I hadn't written with before, but felt it would add a thematic and whimsical tone to the clip. I added distortion and tweaked the EQ in order to make the dialogue sound era-appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Foley, ADR, and Scoring</h3>
        <p>This clip is a minute taken from the animated feature film "Fantastic Mr Fox", in which I stripped the sound from and re-recorded the foley, the voice acting, and composed new music for, as an exercise to practise my sound design for film. I recorded all the sound effects in studio, and took a liking to my first time directing other voice actors.</p>

        <h3 class="pieceTitle">Space Shooter Sound Design</h3>
        <div><iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/886980341?h=3c229c2ca6" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
        <p class="textR">This is a Godot project of a classic space shooter game similar to Galaga and Space Invaders. The sound design for this was done by manipulating various oscillators such as Sine waves and Noise. This was achieved by altering the envelope, automating effects such as EQ and Delay, and layering sounds on top of each other.</p>

        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>This ad was completely self produced including animation, character design, sound mixing, and voice acting, and served as one of the three Smarter Travels Campus finalists that I have been part of. I animated it with very basic tools such as MS paint and Windows movie maker, but did the audio work with more sophisticated software and hardware such as Pro-tools and a MIDI keybaord.</p>

        <h3>Mobile App - Sonic Environments and UI audio</h3>
        <iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/718909822?h=25cf7828cb" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="textR">Sip Factory is a mobile game I am working on with programmer Luke Norton, in which I have supplied the graphics, sound effects and concepts. This is a mobile app that holds hundreds of funny drinking cards at the touch of a button. In this project I created two sonic environments to enhance the atmosphere of the game; a “Sip Factory” soundscape in the menu full of mechanical and liquidy sounds I recorded at home, and the sound of a busy crowd I recorded at a restaurant.</p>

        <h3 class="pieceTitle">2d Platformer Audio</h3>
        <p class="pieceDesc">"Gillbert" is a game concept I created to gain an understanding of Unity. I created the music using the sound design function of Falcon in Pro Tools. Falcon allows you to construct sounds from basic wave forms, as well as sampling audio clips. There is an absense of drums in the track in order to leave sonic space for the many percussive sound effects caused by the player's actions. Many of the sound effects were created by connecting a microphone into my Zoom H4n recorder and layering some on top of each other. I created the visual assets in GIMP and wrote the scripts in C#. Version control was done using Github. Github allowed me to share the project with others when I ran into issues.</p>

        <h3>Live Productions</h3>
        <iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/878988676?h=6bbc98d9bc" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="textR">I have worked in many roles on live productions from setting up equipment, to mixing, to performance. Recently I had the opportunity to work as lead sound designer on Eleanor Feeley’s “Raising the Wind”. The video displayed includes one of the many pieces of sound design I created for the production, which was shown in Glor, Ennis, and will be performed in other Irish theatres.</p>
