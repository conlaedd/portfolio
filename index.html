        <h3 class="pieceTitle">2d Platformer Audio</h3>
        <p class="pieceDesc">"Gillbert" is a game concept I created to gain an understanding of Unity. I created the music using the sound design function of Falcon in Pro Tools. Falcon allows you to construct sounds from basic wave forms, as well as sampling audio clips. There is an absense of drums in the track in order to leave sonic space for the many percussive sound effects caused by the player's actions. Many of the sound effects were created by connecting a microphone into my Zoom H4n recorder and layering some on top of each other. I created the visual assets in GIMP and wrote the scripts in C#. Version control was done using Github. Github allowed me to share the project with others when I ran into issues.</p>

        <h3 class="pieceTitle">Space Shooter Sound Design</h3>
        <div><iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/886980341?h=3c229c2ca6" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
        <p class="textR">This is a Godot project of a classic space shooter game similar to Galaga and Space Invaders. The sound design for this was done by manipulating basic waveforms such as Sine waves and Noise. This was achieved by altering the envelope, automating effects such as EQ and Delay, and layering sounds on top of each other.</p>

        <h3>Foley, ADR, and Scoring</h3>
        <p>This clip is a minute taken from the animated feature film "Fantastic Mr Fox", in which I stripped the sound from and re-recorded the foley, the voice acting, and composed new music for, as an exercise to practise my sound design for film. I recorded all the sound effects in studio, and took a liking to my first time directing other voice actors.</p>

        <h3>Scoring, Mixing and Writing</h3>

        <p class="textR">In this advertisement for Smarter Travels, I pitched the idea to advertise the Leapcard using a 1940s aesthetic to make it stand out. My original script was refined by film students and I worked closely on the project in pre-production and post-production. I studied ragtime songs, a style I hadn't written with before, but felt it would add a thematic and whimsical tone to the clip. I added distortion and tweaked the EQ in order to make the dialogue sound era-appropriate.</p>

        <h3>Animation Re-Foley</h3>
        <p>This is another example of stripping the foley from an existing film scene and re-recording foley using innovative techniques. This was an exercise I undertook in order to strengthen my skills in recorded sound design. Much of the recordings were taken around different locations to force myself to be creaative with location recording. Some of the sounds were created by doing what is shown on screen, such as walking on particular textures and the rustling of clothes. Other sounds required more creativity in it's sound design, such as scraping a hot water bottle across a wooden surface and layering it to achieve different motions of tyres scraping off the road.</p>

        <h3>Mobile App - Sonic Environments and UI audio</h3>
        <iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/718909822?h=25cf7828cb" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="textR">Sip Factory is a mobile game I am working on with programmer Luke Norton, in which I have supplied the graphics, sound effects and concepts. This is a mobile app that holds hundreds of funny drinking cards at the touch of a button. In this project I created two sonic environments to enhance the atmosphere of the game; a “Sip Factory” soundscape in the menu full of mechanical and liquidy sounds I recorded at home, and the sound of a busy crowd I recorded at a restaurant.</p>

        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>This ad was completely self produced including animation, character design, sound mixing, and voice acting, and served as one of the three Smarter Travels Campus finalists that I have been part of. I animated it with very basic tools such as MS paint and Windows movie maker, but did the audio work with more sophisticated software and hardware such as Pro-tools and a MIDI keybaord.</p>

        <h3>Live Productions</h3>
        <iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/878988676?h=6bbc98d9bc" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p class="textR">I have worked in many roles on live productions from setting up equipment, to mixing, to performance. Recently I had the opportunity to work as lead sound designer on Eleanor Feeley’s “Raising the Wind”. The video displayed includes one of the many pieces of sound design I created for the production, which was shown in Glor, Ennis, and will be performed in other Irish theatres.</p>
